### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 was a favorite because in part 2 I got to utilize if and else statements, which I've always found very interesting and created an interactive high-low number guessing game, which was fun to play around with. Another reason why lab 4 was a favorite is because in part 1 I got to utilize some math to convert units. Having a program to convert units is not only super helpful but also fun to create.
