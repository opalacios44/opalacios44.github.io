### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 was a favorite because in part 2 I got to utilize if and else statements, which I've always found very interesting and created an interactive high-low number guessing game, which was fun to play around with. Another reason why lab 4 was a favorite is because in part 1 I got to utilize some math to convert units. Having a program to convert units is not only super helpful but also fun to create. 

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 was a favorite because in part 2 implementing functions for Julian day calculations and date differences felt like solving a real-world problem, and the user input prompts made the program interactive. The structured approach of breaking down the task into seperate functions like PrintDate added clarity to the code. This made it a satisfying and educational coding experience that enhanced my understanding of date manipulation in programming.

    * Lab 6

    Lab 6 was a favorite because when utilizing loops, which allows for efficient repetition of tasks, it really showcased the power of automation in programming. The inclusion of if statements in the lab also introduced decision-making capabilities, enabling the code to respond differently based on specific conditions. I felt that this mix enhanced my problem-solving skills and also provided a foundation for building more complex and versatile programs.
